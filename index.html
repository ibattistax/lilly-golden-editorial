      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img src="images/lillygoldenauthor.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Story is at the heart of great writing. I have been shaping story for
        three decades as an editor and writer, working with authors and agents
        to help bring bestselling, critically acclaimed books to life. My
        experience ranges from historical fiction to literary works of
        nonfiction by award-winning writers—and everything in between. I’ve
        worked extensively with literary fiction, crime novels, thrillers,
        historical novels, and fiction that blurs the line between genres. And,
        in the nonfiction realm, on memoir, true crime, narrative, and
        prescriptive books.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve had the privilege of working with
        <em>New York Times</em> bestselling writers including Jacqueline
        Winspear, F. Lee Bailey, Elizabeth Cobbs, Stephanie Storey, Tom McGuane,
        Jay McInerney, and Joy Williams among hundreds of others of all levels
        of experience, from seasoned professionals to first time authors to
        nonwriters with a great story to tell.

        <span class="bio-book-title"
          >Radical Trauma Healing: A Transformative Program for the LGBTQ+
          Community & Beyond</span
        >, by Andrea Gutiérrez-Glik; and
        <span class="bio-book-title"
          >Beyond Climate Anxiety: Coping, Healing, and Thriving on a Changing
          Planet</span
        >, by Thomas Doherty. I’m currently developing original and IP content
        for TV with producer M. Blair Breard, Barn Burner Entertainment.
