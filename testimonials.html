          “I was referred to Lilly after a succession of other collaborators not
          working out for one reason or another. Lilly was a breath of fresh
          air. I can honestly say that if it wasn’t for Lilly, I would have
          never finished writing my book. She was extremely patient with me. She
          took the time to listen to me. Which helped her understand where I was
          coming from. She cried with me. Laughed with me. She kept reassuring
          me that my ideas mattered and that my voice needed to be heard.”
