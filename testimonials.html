              My fears and doubts were resolved the moment I met Lilly. Lilly
              brings a warmth, understanding, and knowing to her editing work.
              The moment she began working on my project I felt deeping known
              and seen, and that showed up in her ability to bring my voice and
              personality to the editing work. She immediately got me and got
              the project. Her editing took my project from rough, rough draft
              to acceptance from my publisher with an efficiency, skill level,
              and precision only someone who has been doing this for decades,
              and has a true gift with words can produce. That is Lilly. She is
              both gifted and experienced. Kind and professional. If I ever do
              this again, I can't imagine doing it without her.”
